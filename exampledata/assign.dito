#- Varibles are immutable by defualt and created via the `let` keyword.
let x = 100

#- trying to update this varible this would cause an error.
# x = 300

let mut y = 200

#- As we have defined y as mutable this would be fine to do...
y = 3 - y

#- or even any of the inplace operators.
y += x
y %= 100

#- Rationale is that using a combination of constants and duck-typing
#- is useful because...
