# Dito

Dito is high-level, imperative/procedural programing language made as an educational exploration.
It is dynamically typed and is designed with nothing in particular in mind but aims to make short yet readable code. It's syntax is infulenced by Python, Go and APL.

## Datatypes

### Numeric types:
The `Int` (integer) and `Float` types are avilible. For reference their relative types in Go are
**int64** and **float64**. The `Int` type will be automatically promoted to a `Float` if true division takes place or one of the types in a operation is a float. Eg: `10 / 3` -> `3.333` (type Float), `10 // 3` -> `3`.

### Arrays
Arrays a

**String**

* **Bool**:


## Operators:
```python
    :=  # initial assignment
    =   # re-assignment
    +   # additon
    -   # subtraction
    *   # multipication
    /   # division
    //  # integer division
    %   # modulus
    **  # power
    ... # range generator
    ->  # insert right
    <-  # insert left
    ==  # equality
    <>  # non equality
    <=  # less-than equal
    >=  # greater-than equal
    <   # less-than
    >   # greater-than
    not # not
    and # and
    or  # or
```
